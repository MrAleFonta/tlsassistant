      "Description": "The application employs HttpHost, but it defaults to using the 'HTTP' scheme, which is represented by HttpHost.DEFAULT_SCHEME_NAME (HTTP). Utilizing plain HTTP poses a significant security risk because it leaves the data transmitted between the client and server vulnerable to interception and alteration by malicious actors.",

        "Textual": "Please change Default Scheme Name to 'HTTPS'. Also consider to use <a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/java/net/HttpURLConnection#secure-communication-with-https'>HttpsURLConnection</a> instead.<br/> More information about remove support for the Apache HTTP client at this <a href='https://developer.android.com/about/versions/marshmallow/android-6.0-changes#behavior-apache-http-client'>link</a>."
