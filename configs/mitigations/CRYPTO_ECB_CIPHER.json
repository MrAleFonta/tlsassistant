      "Description": "Apps that use a Block Cipher algorithm in ECB mode for encrypting sensitive information are vulnerable to exposing leaking information. The Android platform allows developers to specify the block cipher algorithm and mode they wish to use through the Cipher API.<br/> This behavior is problematic because ECB is not secure for encrypting sensitive information.",
      "Mitigation": {
        "Textual": "Please use an encryption mode other than ECB, like CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) with an initialization vector (IV).<br/> Further information at this links [<a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/crypto/Cipher.html'>1</a>] [<a href='https://medium.com/@manuaravindpta/implementation-of-aes-encryption-in-android-dca250525b4'>2</a>]"
