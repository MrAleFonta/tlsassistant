      "Description": "Using 'SSLCertificateSocketFactory.createSocket()' without parameters or with an 'InetAddress' as the first parameter does not perform hostname verification by default, leaving these sockets susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.",

        "Textual": "Class SSLCertificateSocketFactory was deprecated in API level 29. If application use this class as described previously, it is imperative to verify the server's identity manually after establishing the socket connection.<br/> It's recommended to use use less error-prone alternatives provided by standard APIs for creating SSLSocket instances and verifying hostnames, like SSLSocketFactory#getDefault() or SSLContext.getSocketFactory().<br/> Further information at this <a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/SSLCertificateSocketFactory.html#createSocket(java.net.InetAddress'>link</a>."
