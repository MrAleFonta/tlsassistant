      "Description": "This app does not check the validation of the CN (Common Name) in the SSL certificate (`\"ALLOW_ALL_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER\"` field or `\"AllowAllHostnameVerifier\"` class). This implementations can lead to vulnerabilities which can be used to perform MiTM (Man-in-The-Middle) attacks on network traffic from the victim application.",
      "Mitigation": {
        "Textual": "To strengthen security, any code that bypasses SSL certificate validation should be removed and app should relied to default implementations.<br/>  The solution may vary, depending on the app implementation. <br/> You can find more information on this links [<a href='http://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-ssl.html'>1</a>] [<a href='https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/risks/unsafe-hostname'>2</a>]"
